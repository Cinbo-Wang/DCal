Description: DCal package is designed for treatment effect estimation with high-dimensional nuisance parameters. 
    It uses a new Double-Calibration strategy that corrects the estimation bias of the nuisance parameter estimates
    computated by regularized high-dimensional techniques. Details of the methodology can be found in Lin Liu and Yuhao Wang (2023) 
    "Root-n consistent semiparametric learning with high-dimensional nuisance functions under minimal sparsity"
    <arXiv:2305.04174>. The package relies on the optimisation
    software 'MOSEK' <https://www.mosek.com/> which must be installed separately;
    see the documentation for 'Rmosek'.
